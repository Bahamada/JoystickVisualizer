# Joystick Visualizer

Joystick Visualizer shows a 3D view of the Thrustmaster Warthog joystick and throttle that moves with the real joystick connected to the computer. The idea is to use this for some nice visuals when streaming games or record instructional videos for flight simulators.

The background is set to a solid ```#1E3D5D``` (or RGB: ```31,62,93```) for chroma keying.

Because of the way Unity handles joystick input, stopping any joystick input if the window is not in focus, the software is divided into two parts: The Joystick Visualizer and the Joystick Proxy.

The Joystick Proxy feeds joystick state to the Joystick Visualizer over a local TCP port (9998) so that it can be visualized even if the application is not the focused window.

## Usage

### Starting the Software

To use, start both the Joystick Proxy and the Joystick Visualizer. The Visualizer will ask you to select a resolution, since the window will usually be downscaled I find it works best when set to 640x480 and make sure to select Windowed mode.

If the Visualizer window with the virtual joystick has a yellow lighting bolt in the upper left corner it means that it does not yet have a connection to the Proxy.

Once a connection is established the lightning bolt will dissapear and you should be able to see your joystick movement in the Visualizer window.

### Setup OBS

In OBS add a Window Capture source, give it a useful name like Joystick Visualizer, select Inner Window, enable Color Key and set the color to ```#1E3D5D``` or RGB: ```31,62,93``` and save your changes.

Then click on Preview Stream to get a video preview of how it will look. Click on Edit Scene, select the Joystick Visualizer source and move and scale it, and move it so that the UI camera buttons are hidden outside of the visual field.
